"""prior_art_flood â€“ one-click dump of remixed artefacts as immutable prior art.

This tool copies every artefact tagged ``remixed`` into ``prior_art/``
(where each file name is ``<artefact_id>.json``).  In real deployments this
could push to IPFS/Arweave; here we just create the folder so diff is visible.
